Small Angle Neutron Scattering - BIO-SANS
==================================

.. _biosans:

Overview
-----------------------------------
Bio-SANS users are focused on Biology and biomaterials.

Data Reduction Process
-----------------------------------
They currently use jupyter scripts. Mantid is another way
to do the reduction. The staff at ORNL use DRT-SANS to reduce the data.

Data Reduction Software
-----------------------------------
Overview
    “Instrument scientists can calibrate instruments and reduce
    large quantities of datasets. Users can correct the collected data
    with dark current subtraction and normalization by neutron
    flux, detector sensitivity, solid angle subtended by the detectors,
    and scaling to absolute units.” [26]

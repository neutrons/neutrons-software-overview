Spectroscopy - Direct-Geometry and Triple-Axis Group

How is data reduced for the Direct Geometry and Triple-Axis Group?
-----------------------------------
For direct geometry instruments (CNCS, HYSPEC, SEQUIOA, ARCS), 
data is reduced using auto-reduction. These are scripts using mantid. 
These custom scripts live in the instrument computer, where everyone 
has access to them.

For triple-axis (CTAX, PTAX, TAX, VERITAS), data is already reduced. 
The program to visualize these results is Graffiti, which is a part 
of Spice. Graffiti’s underlying software is Labview. Dave, Shiver, 
Horace are all used for reduction or visualization. Visualization 
is important for single crystal, 3D structure.

Overview
    “The main objective of DAVE is to provide a user friendly tool for 
    scientists involved in neutron scattering research to quickly reduce, 
    visualize and interpret their data” [11]

Useful Links and Resources
    The Dave website includes links to user manuals, paper, documentation, 
    course notes, downloads, features, screenshots, changelogs, and more.

Reflectometry
==================================

Data Reduction Software
-----------------------------------
Each of these instruments have their own reduction software. For MAGREF, the
software is QuickNXS and for LIQREF, the software is RefRed.

Data Analysis Software
-----------------------------------

Refl1D
```````````````````````````````
Overview
```````````````````````````````
“Refl1D is a program for analyzing 1D reflectometry
measurements made with X-ray and neutron beamlines. The
1-D models give the depth profile for material scattering
density composed of a mixture of flat and continuously
varying freeform layers. With polarized neutron
measurements, scientists can study the sub-surface structure
of magnetic samples. The architecture supports the addition
of specialized layer types such as models for the density
distribution of polymer brushes, and volume space modeling
for proteins in bio-membranes” (`Refl1D Contributors <https://github.com/reflectometry/refl1d>`).

“GenX is a versatile program using the differential evolution
algorithm for fitting, primarily, X-ray and neutron reflectivity
data, lately also surface x-ray diffraction data” (`GenX Contributors <https://aglavic.github.io/genx/>`_).

refnx
```````````````````````````````
Overview
```````````````````````````````
“refnx is a flexible, powerful, Python package for generalised
curvefitting analysis, specifically neutron and X-ray
reflectometry data" (`Refnx Contributors <https://refnx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_).

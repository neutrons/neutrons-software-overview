drtsans
```````````````````````````````
Overview
    “Instrument scientists can calibrate instruments and reduce
    large quantities of datasets. Users can correct the collected data
    with dark current subtraction and normalization by neutron
    flux, detector sensitivity, solid angle subtended by the detectors,
    and scaling to absolute units.” [26]

USANSRED

Overview
    USANSRED is branched off from USANSDATA to be the data reduction section of the code.

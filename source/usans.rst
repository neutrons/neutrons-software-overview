==================================

Overview
-----------------------------------
USANS users are focused on .

Data Reduction Process
-----------------------------------
They currently use two different scripts, drtsans and USANSRED. 

Data Reduction Software
-----------------------------------
drtsans
```````````````````````````````
Overview
    “Instrument scientists can calibrate instruments and reduce
    large quantities of datasets. Users can correct the collected data
    with dark current subtraction and normalization by neutron
    flux, detector sensitivity, solid angle subtended by the detectors,
    and scaling to absolute units.” [26]

Overview

    USANSRED is branched off from USANSDATA to be the data reduction 
    section of the code.

    There is a repository by the same name for the software with links to its
    documentation.

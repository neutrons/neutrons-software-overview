Data Reduction Process
-----------------------------------
For direct geometry instruments (CNCS, HYSPEC, SEQUIOA, ARCS), 
data is reduced using auto-reduction. These are scripts using mantid. 
These custom scripts live in the instrument computer, where everyone 
has access to them.

For triple-axis (CTAX, PTAX, TAX, VERITAS), data is already reduced. 
The program to visualize these results is Graffiti, which is a part 
of Spice. Graffitiâ€™s underlying software is Labview. Dave, Shiver, 
Horace are all used for reduction or visualization. Visualization 
is important for single crystal, 3D structure.

Data Analysis Process
-----------------------------------

Spectroscopy investigates interactions, while, for example, 
Diffraction investigates how atoms are arranged. Interactions 
are more complicated than structure and, for example, a magnetism 
perspective may be relevant.

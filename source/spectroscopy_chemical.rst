Spectroscopy - Chemical Spectroscopy Group
==================================

.. _spectroscopy_chemical:

Overview
-----------------------------------
The subject matter for the Chemical Spectroscopy Group is vibrational or 
diffusive dynamics, which often attracts scientists with a biology or chemistry 
background. However, technically, what the two instruments (VISION & BASIS) 
measure are very different, and consequently the data analysis workflows 
are also different.

Data Reduction Process
-----------------------------------
At BASIS, most users are assisted by the instrument scientists to reduce 
the data. There are existing algorithms in Mantid and experienced users 
can easily reduce the data by themselves. At VISION, all data is reduced 
automatically. These are python scripts that are view for anyone to inspect 
at analysis.sns.gov. Some of the post-reduction operations include merging 
the data that is saved hour by hour and smoothing. For the NSE instrument 
(part of the SANS & Spin Echo Group), which is a very different technique 
than all the other instruments, the reduction software that is used is DrSpine.

Data Analysis Process
-----------------------------------

Spectroscopy investigates interactions, while, for example, 
Diffraction investigates how atoms are arranged. Interactions 
are more complicated than structure and, for example, a magnetism 
perspective may be relevant.

Data Analysis Software
-----------------------------------
There are lots of software packages that can be used, it is ultimately the 
userâ€™s choice. The data is usually a 1-dimensional spectrum. Oclimax is one 
example of software that is being used. Some of the main functions include 
analyzing lattice dynamics, phonon calculations.

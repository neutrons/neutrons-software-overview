Reflectometry
===============================

Overview
-----------------------------------
The Reflectometry Group focuses on probing thin structures through the use of 
neutronsâ€™ refractive properties and can help identify the composition of the
sample. There are two types of reflectometry instruments housed at ORNL,
magnetic and liquid reflectometers.

Data Reduction Process
-----------------------------------
The data reduction is automatically  reduced by an instrument specific script 
or by using an instrument specific software.
